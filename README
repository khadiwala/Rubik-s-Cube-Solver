Rubik's Cube Solver v0
By Ravi Khadiwala - CS242 spring, 2011

GRAPHICAL APPLICATION:

    You can use a graphical interface for the solver by running guicube.py. 
    
    From here you can:
    
        - See a visual representation of the cube as it's being solved
        - Manually manipulate the cube through individual rotations
        - Scramble the cube, applying 200 random moves to the cube (
        - Solve the cube (solve cube)
        - View the solution length and sequence (solution info)

STEPPING THROUGH A SOLUTION:

    You can step through a solution of a cube based on a scramble string by
    running solstepper.py.
    
    Usage:
        - Enter a scramble string (f,r,u,l,d,b,',2,3) with '23 appearing after a letter
        - Press enter to iterate through the solution

CUBE LIBRARY:

    The cube library represents cubes as a list of faces and functions for
    manipulating them. You can manipulate the cube instance with the rotation
    functions F(),R(),L(),B(),U(),D() which correspond to rotations of front,
    right,left,back,up,and down faces. You can do a series of moves with do_string()

SOLVER LIBRARY:

    Uses a naieve algorithm to solve a cube.
    
    Usage:
        - Create a solver instance
        - Manipulate cube or input cube state by setting faces with face.shift_face()
        - solve()
    
        solmoves will contain a string with the moves used to solve the cube
